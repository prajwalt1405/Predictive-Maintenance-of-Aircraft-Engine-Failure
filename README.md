## Introduction
This project focuses on **predictive maintenance of aircraft engines** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**. It aims to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines to prevent failures and optimize maintenance schedules, improving safety and operational efficiency.

## Problem Definition
Traditional maintenance strategies like **run-to-failure** or **fixed-schedule maintenance** lead to inefficiencies, high costs, and unplanned downtime. This project proposes a **data-driven predictive maintenance approach** to:
- Predict engine failure in advance.
- Reduce unscheduled maintenance costs.
- Enhance safety and reliability.

## Objectives
- Implement an **LSTM-based predictive maintenance** system.
- Forecast **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** for aircraft engines.
- Optimize maintenance schedules and **reduce operational costs**.
- Improve safety by **early failure detection**.
- Leverage **deep learning** to analyze time-series sensor data.

## Dataset
- **NASA C-MAPSS Dataset**
- Contains **operational sensor data** from multiple aircraft engines.
- Includes **engine cycles, sensor readings, and failure events**.
- Preprocessed for **feature engineering and normalization**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep Learning framework
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning utilities
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

## Installation and Setup
```bash

# Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Run the preprocessing and model training script:
python train_model.py
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Normalize sensor readings.
   - Create **RUL labels** and **sequential time-series data**.

2. **LSTM Model Training**
   - Design a **2-layer LSTM** network.
   - Compile using **Adam optimizer** and **binary cross-entropy/MSE loss**.
   - Train with **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.

3. **Evaluation & Prediction**
   - Evaluate on test data.
   - Predict RUL for given engine unit IDs.
   - Visualize model performance.

## Model Architecture
- **Input:** Sequential data from engine sensors (last 70 cycles).
- **LSTM Layer 1:** 100 units, returns sequences.
- **LSTM Layer 2:** 50 units.
- **Dense Layer:** Single output neuron (sigmoid for classification, linear for regression).
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate **0.004**.
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (for failure classification) / Mean Squared Error (for RUL prediction).

## Results
- Model successfully predicts **engine failures within 30 cycles**.
- **Accuracy and Recall** are optimized for classification tasks.
- **Mean Squared Error** used for RUL estimation shows promising results.
- **Visualization** of learning curves and sensor data over time.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of **LSTM-based predictive maintenance** in aviation. The model successfully forecasts **engine failures** and **RUL**, reducing unscheduled downtime and maintenance costs while improving **operational safety**.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with real-time IoT sensors**.
- **Hybrid models combining LSTM with CNNs**.
- **Cloud-based deployment** for scalability.
- **Explainable AI techniques** to improve interpretability.
- **Adaptive maintenance scheduling** based on real-world data.
